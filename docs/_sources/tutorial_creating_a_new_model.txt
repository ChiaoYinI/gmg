**3.0 Creating a new model**
----------------------------

Once you have opened GMG (follow the instructions on the :ref:`installation` page if this is your first
time using the software) you can create a new model by navigating to the Menubar and selecting::

    File -> New model...

A window for setting the model dimensions will appear. Here we wil assign the model X and Z dimensions in
kilometers, as well as the increment at which the predicted gravity and magnetic anomalies will be calculated at.
In this example our model profile is 50 km long, so lets set the X-coordinates as 0 and 50 km. We will be modelling the
upper crustal structure, so lets set the Z-coordinates as 0 and 10 km and the calculation increment as 0.5 km.

.. note::

    you can always change the model dimensions and increment at a later time. For example, you may start out by
    modelling with a coarse spacing to ensure GMG runs smoothly. Then, once you are satisfied with your starting model
    and are ready to make smaller, fine scale changes towards completion of your model you might then lower the
    calculation interval.

    To modify the model dimensions at anytime, navigate to::

        Model View -> Modify current model dimensions...
