** 1.0 Introduction**
---------------------

In this tutorial we model the gravity and magnetic anomalies produced by the Weardale granite in the Northern
Pennines, UK, using data published by \cite{bott1967}. The tutorial will walk through the following steps:


1. How to create a new 2D model and save this to disc for reloading later.

2. How to load observed 2D profile data (both Bouguer gravity and magnetic anomalies) into your GMG modelling
   environment.

3. How to load borehole horizon top data your GMG modelling environment.

4. How to add new layers to your model and assign attributes (e.g. bulk density) to them.

5. How to set your model profiles magnetic field attributes (e.g. the strength of Earth's field).

6. How to run forward model calculations of the predicted gravity and magnetic anomalies.

7. How to use the GMG interface for forward modelling.

8. How to save the predicted anomaly profiles as text files.

9. How to produce a raster figure and save this to disc using GMGs input figure production module.
