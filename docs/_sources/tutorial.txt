**Tutorial**
============

**1.0 Introduction**
--------------------

In this tutorial we will learn how to use GMG by modelling an example data set. We will systematically work through the
steps required to load data and model the gravity and magnetic anomalies produced by the Weardale granite in the
Northern Pennines, UK. Thereby recreating the study published by a renowned British geophysicist, the late Martin
Bott (Bott, 1967) :cite:`bott1967`.

The tutorial will walk through the following steps::

    1. Creating a new model and how to save and reload models.

    2. Loading observed 2D profile data (both Bouguer gravity and magnetic anomalies) into your GMG modelling
       environment.

    3. Loading borehole horizon top data into your GMG modelling environment.

    4. Adding new layers to your model and assigning attributes (e.g. bulk density) to them.

    5. Setting magnetic field attributes in your model (e.g. the strength of Earth's field).

    6. Running forward model calculations of the predicted gravity and magnetic anomalies.

    7. How to use the GMG interface for forward modelling.

    8. How to save the predicted anomaly profiles as external text files.

    9. How to produce a raster figure and save this to disc using GMGs inbuilt figure production module.

    10. How to load 2D seismic reflection data into a model.

The Weardale granite is located in the Northern Pennines, UK. The presence of this Caledonian-aged granite was first
proposed by Dunham (1934) as a means of explaining observed lead-zinc mineralization in nearby outcrops. Later gravity
surveys and magnetic surveys by various authors strongly  corroborated this suggestion. :numref:`gravity_map` and
:numref:`magnetic_map` show collations of these data published by Bott, (1967) :cite:`bott1967`. Its presence was
finally confirmed with the drilling of the Rookhope borehole (Dunham et al., 1961). The location of this borehole is
shown as the yellow circle in :numref:`gravity_map` and :numref:`magnetic_map`.

    Land based Bouguer gravity anomaly contoured at 1 mGal increments (digitized after, Fig. 2 from :cite:`bott1967`). The red line
    A-A* shows the profile we will model in this tutorial and is chosen to intersect the Rookhope well (yellow circle).
    The data are projected on a local cartesian grid.

    :name: magnetic_map

    Areo-magnetic anomaly map acquired at an average elevation of 305 m above the ground surface,
    flown with a line spacing and 2 km and contoured at 10 nT increments.


**2.0 Creating a new model**
----------------------------

Once you have opened GMG (follow the instructions on the :ref:`installation` page if this is your first
time using the software) you can create a new model by navigating to the Menubar and selecting::

    File -> New model...

A window for setting the model dimensions will appear. Here we wil assign the model X and Z dimensions in
kilometers, as well as the increment at which the predicted gravity and magnetic anomalies will be calculated at.
In this example our model profile is 50 km long, so lets set the X-coordinates as 0 and 50 km. We will be modelling the
upper crustal structure, so lets set the Z-coordinates as 0 and 10 km and the calculation increment as 0.5 km.

.. note::

    you can always change the model dimensions and increment at a later time. For example, you may start out by
    modelling with a coarse spacing to ensure GMG runs smoothly. Then, once you are satisfied with your starting model
    and are ready to make smaller, fine scale changes towards completion of your model you might then lower the
    calculation interval.

    To modify the model dimensions at anytime, navigate to::

        Model View -> Modify current model dimensions...

**3.0 Loading observed porifle data**
-------------------------------------

Now we have creating our model, we can load the observed gravity and magnetic anomaly data into the modelling
environment. First, lets load the gravity data by navigating to::

    Gravity -> Load Gravity Anomaly...

Now select the **File...** button and use the file explorer to navigate to and select the file
**bott_Bouguer_gravity.xg**. This file is located in the directory::

    gmg/docs/tutorial/GRAVITY_DATA

Now lets name the data **Bouguer anomaly** and leave the display color as the default **blue**. Finally, select the
**Load** button to load the data.

You should now see the observed Bouguer gravity anomaly in the Gravity panel.

Lets repeat this process for the magnetic anomaly data **bott_Magnetic_anomaly.xm** located in the directory::

    gmg/docs/tutorial/MAGNETIC_DATA

**4.0 Loading well data**
-------------------------

THe Rookhope exploration well was drilled above the Weardale granite between November 1960 - July 1961 in order to
prove its existence. The well was drilled at a location 322.76 m Above mean sea level (AMSL) and revealed a 390 m thick
sequence of Carboniferous sediment before penetrating the granite (at a depth of 67.24 m BMSL) and continued through the
granite reaching a bottom depth of 808 m (485.25 m BMSL) while still within the pluton.

This record provides a``ground-truth" point with which to constrain our forward model. THe petrological data from the
well also provides constrain on the density of the granite.

Now lets load the well record into our modelling environment by navigating to::

    Well data -> Load well record...

Now use the file explorer to navigate to the file **Rookhope.txt** located in the directory::

    /gmg/docs/tutorial/WELL_DATA

You will be prompted to provide a name for the new well record, let call it Rookhope.

The well record will now be visible in the model frame. We can hide/show the well by navigating to::

    Well data -> Wells... -> Rookhope -> Hide/Show

We can also change the text size of the well horizons labels using the **Label Text Size** slider in the Layer
Attributes tool box located on the left hand side of the modelling environment.


**5.0 Creating a model layer**
------------------------------

Now we have loaded our observed anomaly data into the model environment, we are ready to start constructing our model.

To add a new layer to the model navigate to the *'Layers'* menu and select *'New Layer'*::

    Layers -> New Layer

Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut, **n** key.

You will be prompted with the option of adding a *'New fixed layer'* or a *'New floating layer'*.

**Floating layers:**

Floating layers are polygons that are fully contained within the model space. For example, a narrow salt dome.

**Fixed layers:**

Fixed layers span the entire width of the model and are useful for modelling *layers*, such as sedimentary basin
strata. Fixed layers have fixed boundary nodes that can only be moved vertically along the model edges.

.. note::

    Fixed layers are automatically *'padded'* horizontally from the boundary nodes by an additional 400 km in order to
    avoid edge effects.

Lets chose to create a new **floating** layer, which we will use to represent the Weardale granite.

When creating a new floating layer, you must assign the X and Y coordinates of four nodes that will define the layer.
These nodes **must** be input in anti-clockwise order to ensure layers field effects are calculated with the correct
sign. Beside the ordering of the nodes, there actual positions are not important as then can easily be modified using
the mouse once the layer has been created.

Lets set the initial node positions for our new floating layer as follows::

    X1: 10    Y1: 1
    X2: 10    Y2: 8
    X3: 30    Y3: 8
    X4: 30    Y4: 1

Finally, select ``Create layer". The new layer will appear in the modelling environment.

We can rename the layer from its default name of ``layer 1" by twice single clicking its name under the ``Layers" menu
on the middle left ``Controls panel". Lets rename the layer ``Weardale".


**6.0 Setting layer attributes**
--------------------------------

Now that we have created a new floating layer to represent the Weardale granite, lets assign its bulk density for
gravity modelling. We will also assign a ``background density" used to represent the surrounding basement rock. The
difference between these two values represents the ``density contrast" used for calculating the gravity effect of the
granite.

:cite:`Kimbell2010` Kimbell et al., (2010) suggest that 2.78 g/cm3 is a reasonable bulk density for the Lower Palaeozoic
rocks of the ``Alston Block", within which the Weardale granite is found. While measurements made on rock fragments
recovered from the Rookhope borehole suggest the granites bulk density is close to 2.63 g/cm3 (Bott, 1967)
:cite:`bott1967`.

Lets use these values to begin our modelling. To set the bulk density of our first layer.

First, select the ``Weardale" layer under the menu by double clicking on its name. We can now set the bulk density and
reference density values under the ``Layer Attributes" top left control panel. Once you have assigned the values click
``Set layer attributes" to make the changes.


**0.0 Seismic data**
--------------------
Any 2D Seismic SEGY data can be loaded into GMG models, however, to be useful, it is highly recommended these data are
pre-processed in the depth domain.

As an example, we will download the freely available Society of exploration geophysicists (SEG) Advanced Modeling
Program (SEAM) Phase 1 data. This is a synthetic 35 x 40 x 15 km 3D cube that simulates a realistic salt canopy.

These data can be accessed by following this link::

    https://seg.org/News-Resources/Research-Data/Open-Data

And then by clicking the link::

    Interpretation Challenge I - Depth

This will direct you to a google drive folder containing the data.

Once you have downloaded the directory SEAM_Interpretation_Challenge_1_Depth/ move this to
"YOUR_GMG_PATH"/gmg/docs/tutorial/SEISMIC_DATA e.g.::

    mv SEAM_Interpretation_Challenge_1_Depth/ "YOUR_GMG_PATH"/gmg/docs/tutorial/SEISMIC_DATA

Now, to plot a profile with GMG lets extract a 2D profile from the 3D volume using an ObsPy routine.

A script is provided with this tutorial to preform the extraction of a profile at Y-location 24 km. This profile passes
through a borehole location that can alos be loaded into GMG for aiding interpretation.

To run the profile extraction follow these commands::

    cd "YOUR_GMG_PATH"/gmg/docs/tutorial/SEISMIC_DATA
    mv ../cut_2d_profile.py .
    python cut_2d_profile.py SEAM_Interpretation_Challenge_1_Depth.sgy

.. note::

    The next step is not required, but if you have Seismic Un*x installed on your computer, or are willing to install
    it (see https://github.com/JohnWStockwellJr/SeisUnix), then the following is recommended.

Now, lets use the open source seismic processing package SeismicUnix to apply an automatic gain control (AGC) to our
SEGY profile in order to balance the amplitudes before we load the profile into GMG for viewing/interpretation::

    segyread tape=2d_profile_24000N.segy verbose=1 endian=0 | segyclean > 2d_profile_24000N.su

    sugain agc=1 < 2d_profile_24000N.su > 2d_profile_24000N_agc.su

    segyhdrs < agc.su hfile=hheader bfile=bheader

    segywrite < 2d_profile_24000N_agc.su verbose=1 buff=1 tape=2d_profile_24000N_agc.segy bfile=bheader hfile=hheader

We now have a SEGY file ready for importing to GMG.

Open a new GMG window and create a new model (as outlined in Section 1) with dimensions 35 x 15 km. Now, navigate to the
SEGY Data menu in the menubar and select *Load SEGY...*.

You will be prompted by a window in which to enter the dimensions of the SEGY file and name of the segy file. Input the
dimensions x = 0 35 and y = 0 15 and give the file a name, e.g. profile_24N. Now select *Set Coordinates*.

A file explorer will now load. Naivage to the SEGY file (i.e. either 2d_profile_24000N_agc.segy or
2d_profile_24000N.segy) you want to load and select *Open*.

You should now see the seismic profile in your GMG modelling frame!

Try Changing the color palette from grey scale to Red-white-Blue by using::

    Seismic Data -> Color palette -> Seismic

Now try adjusting the display Gain using::

     Seismic Data -> Gain -> Increase...

or the left and right arrow keyboard shortcuts.
