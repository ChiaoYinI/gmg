**Introduction**

In this tutorial we investigate the gravity and magnetic anomalies produced by the Weardale granite in the Northern
Pennines, UK, using the data and paper published by \cite{bott1967}. The tutorial will walk through the following steps:


1. Create a new GMG 2D model.

2. Load observed 2D profiles of both Bouguer gravity and magnetic anomalies into the GMG environment.

3. Load observed well horizon data into the GMG environment.

4. Add new layers to the modelling environment and assign attributes to these features.

5. Calculate the predicted gravity and magnetic anomalies.

6. Practice forward modelling.

7. Write predicted anomaly profiles to disc.

8. Produce a raster figure and save this to disc using GMGs input figure constructor.
