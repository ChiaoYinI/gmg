** 1.0 Introduction**
---------------------

In this tutorial we model the gravity and magnetic anomalies produced by the Weardale granite in the Northern
Pennines, UK, using data published by \cite{bott1967}. The tutorial will walk through the following steps:


1. How to create a new 2D model and save this to disc for reloading later.

2. How to load observed 2D profile data (both Bouguer gravity and magnetic anomalies) into your GMG modelling
   environment.

3. How to load borehole horizon top data your GMG modelling environment.

4. How to add new layers to your model and assign attributes (e.g. bulk density) to them.

5. How to set your model profiles magnetic field attributes (e.g. the strength of Earth's field).

6. How to run forward model calculations of the predicted gravity and magnetic anomalies.

7. How to use the GMG interface for forward modelling.

8. How to save the predicted anomaly profiles as text files.

9. How to produce a raster figure and save this to disc using GMGs input figure production module.

We'll also create a separate model

-----------------------------
** 2.0 Creating a new model**
-----------------------------

To create a new model, on the Menubar navigate to::

    File -> New model...

You will be prompted with a window to set the model X and Z dimensions in kilometers as well as the increment with which
the predicted gravity and magnetic anomalies will be calculated at. Our model profile is 50 km long, so lets set the
X-coordinates as 0 and 50 km. We will be modelling the upper crustal structure, so lets set the Z-coordinates as
0 and 10 km. Lets set the increment as 0.5 km. Note, you can always change the increment at a later time,
for example, once you are reasonably happy with your starting model and want to make smaller, fine scale changes
towards completion of your model.


Also note, you can also change the model dimensions at anytime by navigating
to::

    Model View -> Modify current model dimensions...

------------------------------
** 3.0 Loading observed data**
------------------------------

To add a new layer to the model navigate to the *'Layers'* menu and select *'New Layer'*::

    Layers -> New Layer -> New fixed layer
                        -> New floating layer

Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut, **n** key.

You will be prompted with the option of adding a *'New fixed layer'* or a *'New floating layer'*.

**Floating layers:**

Floating layers are polygons that are fully contained within the model space. For example, a narrow salt dome.

**Fixed layers:**

Fixed layers span the entire width of the model and are useful for modelling features such as sedimentary basin
formations. Fixed layers have fixed boundary nodes that can only be moved vertically along the model edges.

..note:

    Fixed layers are automatically *'padded'* horizontally from the boundary nodes by an additional 400 km in order to
    avoid edge effects.

** 0.0 Seismic data**
---------------------
Any 2D Seismic SEGY data can be loaded into GMG models, however, to be useful, it is highly recommended these data are
pre-processed in the depth domain.

As an example, we will download the freely available Society of exploration geophysicists (SEG) Advanced Modeling
Program (SEAM) Phase 1 data. This is a synthetic 35 x 40 x 15 km 3D cube that simulates a realistic salt canopy.

These data can be accessed by following this link::

    https://seg.org/News-Resources/Research-Data/Open-Data

And then by clicking the link::

    Interpretation Challenge I - Depth

This will direct you to a google drive folder containing the data.

Once you have downloaded the directory SEAM_Interpretation_Challenge_1_Depth/ move this to
"YOUR_GMG_PATH"/gmg/docs/tutorial/SEISMIC_DATA e.g.::

    mv SEAM_Interpretation_Challenge_1_Depth/ "YOUR_GMG_PATH"/gmg/docs/tutorial/SEISMIC_DATA

Now, to plot a profile with GMG lets extract a 2D profile from the 3D volume using an ObsPy routine.

A script is provided with this tutorial to preform the extraction of a profile at Y-location 24 km. This profile passes
through a borehole location that can alos be loaded into GMG for aiding interpretation.

To run the profile extraction follow these commands::

    cd "YOUR_GMG_PATH"/gmg/docs/tutorial/SEISMIC_DATA
    mv ../cut_2d_profile.py .
    python cut_2d_profile.py SEAM_Interpretation_Challenge_1_Depth.sgy

.. note::

    The next step is not required, but if you have Seismic Un*x installed on your computer, or are willing to install
    it (see https://github.com/JohnWStockwellJr/SeisUnix), then the following is recommended.

Now, lets use the open source seismic processing package SeismicUnix to apply an automatic gain control (AGC) to our
SEGY profile in order to balance the amplitudes before we load the profile into GMG for viewing/interpretation::

    segyread tape=2d_profile_24000N.segy verbose=1 endian=0 | segyclean > 2d_profile_24000N.su

    sugain agc=1 < 2d_profile_24000N.su > 2d_profile_24000N_agc.su

    segyhdrs < 2d_profile_24000N_agc.su hfile=hheader bfile=bheader

    segywrite < 2d_profile_24000N_agc.su verbose=1 buff=1 tape=2d_profile_24000N_agc.segy bfile=bheader hfile=hheader

We now have a SEGY file ready for importing to GMG.

Open a new GMG window and create a new model (as outlined in Section 1) with dimensions 35 x 15 km. Now, navigate to the
SEGY Data menu in the menubar and select *Load SEGY...*.

You will be prompted by a window in which to enter the dimensions of the SEGY file and name of the segy file. Input the
dimensions x = 0 35 and y = 0 15 and give the file a name, e.g. profile_24N. Now select *Set Coordinates*.

A file explorer will now load. Naivage to the SEGY file (i.e. either 2d_profile_24000N_agc.segy or
2d_profile_24000N.segy) you want to load and select *Open*.

You should now see the seismic profile in your GMG modelling frame!

Try Changing the color palette from grey scale to Red-white-Blue by using::

    Seismic Data -> Color palette -> Seismic

Now try adjusting the display Gain using::

     Seismic Data -> Gain -> Increase...

or the left and right arrow keyboard shortcuts.
