**4.0 Potential field data**

------------------------------------
**4.1 Potential field calculations**
------------------------------------
The Menubar contains buttons **G** and **M**.
These are used as switches for turning potential field calculations for the gravity and magnetic anomalies on and off.

.. hint::

    If the model becomes complex (i.e. contains many layers and nodes), turing off the predicted anomalies can help
    speed up the GUI response time.

.. note::

    You must set the magnetic inclination and Earth Field values under the *Magnetic Field* Menu before
    the predicted magnetic anomaly can be calculated.

.. Important::
    *Strike* is the angle (in degrees) that the strike of the unit in map view makes with respect to magnetic north
    (the angle is positive when measured counterclockwise). See :ref:`A2 <magnetic_algorithm>` for further details.
    The strike of the unit is assumed to be orthogonal to the model transect (striking into and out of the screen).

.. admonition:: Example

    If the model is orientated West-East and magnetic north is -22 deg the strike of the unit is -22 deg.

    If the model was orientated North-South the angle would be 68 deg.

**4.2 Loading observed potential field data**
---------------------------------------------
To load observed potential field data click on the *Observed* menu in the Menubar and select either
*Load observed Gravity anomaly* or *Load observed Magnetic anomaly*.
Next Navigate to the file you want to load and select it.
The file will automatically be loaded into the canvas.

.. note::

    These files should be ASCII text files with X values in the first column and the anomaly value
    in the second column. These files may have any suffix.
