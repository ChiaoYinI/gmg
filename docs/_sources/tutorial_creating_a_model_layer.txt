**6.0 Creating a model layer**
------------------------------

Now we have loaded our observed anomaly data into the model environment, we are ready to start constructing our model.

To add a new layer to the model navigate to the *'Layers'* menu and select *'New Layer'*::

    Layers -> New Layer

Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut, **n** key.

You will be prompted with the option of adding a *'New fixed layer'* or a *'New floating layer'*.

**Floating layers:**

Floating layers are polygons that are fully contained within the model space. For example, a narrow salt dome.

**Fixed layers:**

Fixed layers span the entire width of the model and are useful for modelling *layers*, such as sedimentary basin
strata. Fixed layers have fixed boundary nodes that can only be moved vertically along the model edges.

.. note::

    Fixed layers are automatically *'padded'* horizontally from the boundary nodes by an additional 400 km in order to
    avoid edge effects.

Lets chose to create a new **floating** layer, which we will use to represent the Weardale granite.

When creating a new floating layer, you must assign the X and Y coordinates of four nodes that will define the layer.
These nodes **must** be input in anti-clockwise order to ensure layers field effects are calculated with the correct
sign. Beside the ordering of the nodes, there actual positions are not important as then can easily be modified using
the mouse once the layer has been created.

Lets set the initial node positions for our new floating layer as follows::

    X1: 10    Y1: 1
    X2: 10    Y2: 8
    X3: 30    Y3: 8
    X4: 30    Y4: 1

Finally, select ``Create layer``. The new layer will appear in the modelling environment.

We can rename the layer from its default name of ``layer 1`` by twice single clicking its name under the ``Layers`` menu
on the middle left ``Controls panel``. Lets rename the layer ``Weardale``.
