**2.0 Pre-modelling considerations**
====================================

As we are interested in modelling the structure of the Weardale granite, an important processing step prior to modelling
is to consider the other factors contributing to the total gravity anomaly.

One common step is to preform a separation of the "regional" component of the gravity anomaly from the total anomaly
in order to remove the contribution from sub-crustal density anomalies. As these anomalies are generated from deep
sources, they are of much longer wavelength than that produced by our target, which resides in the upper crust.

There are several strategies for calculating the regional gravity anomaly component but here we will use that determined
by :cite:`Kimbell2011` as shown in :numref:`regional_gravity_map`. As can be seen there is a long wavelength positive
anomaly anomaly with amplitudes ranging :math:`\sim` :math:`14-21` :math:`mGal`.

    Regional gravity anomaly related to long-wavelength sub-crustal density anomalies from :cite:`Kimbell2011`. The
    red line A-A* shows the profile we will model in this tutorial and is chosen to intersect the Rookhope well
    (yellow circle). The data are projected on a local cartesian grid.
