    <h2>Overview</h2>


FaT-FM is designed primarily as a Graphical user interface (GUI) for
2D forward modelling of gravity and magnetic potential field data.
FaT-FM can also load SEGY, borehole and point data and hence can be used
as a full 2D geologic/geophysical profile interpretation package.

FaT-FM is written in python 2.7 using wx.python for GUI implementation.
FaT-FM makes use of several other open source python packages to preform various 
tasks (see `References <references.html>`_ for a detailed listing).

Version: Beta-0.1

Urgent bugs:

* 101: New node positions get tangled when there are many nodes in close proximity.
* 102: Can't delete layers.
* 103: Adding point data needs work.
