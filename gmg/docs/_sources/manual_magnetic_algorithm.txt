**A2 Talwani and Heirtzler (1964) magnetic algorithm**
======================================================

Magnetic anomalies are calculated using a python implementation of Talwani and Heirtzler's (1964) :cite:`talwani1964`
algorithm for two-dimensional uniformly magnetised bodies. This employs a similar procedure to that
described in Section :ref:`A1 <manual_gravity_algorithm>` for calculating two-dimensional gravity anomalies
by treating a body as an n-sided polygon, solving the anomaly for each side and summing the result.
However, in the case of magnetic anomalies, there is added complexity owing to the fact that a given
bodies magnetisation vector is, for the case of induced magnetisation, dependent on the inclination,
delineation and magnitude of the inducing magnetic field (i.e., Earth's magnetic field). Moreover, if
the body has retained a remanent magnetisation, then the magnetisation vector may vary from that of the
local Earth field. Furthermore, for two-dimensional modelling, the relationship between the model profile azimuth
and the magnetisation vector must also be considered.

These complexities are handled by considering the vertical and horizontal components of the total magnetisation
vector separately and then summing these components at the final calculation step. Following the trigonometric
parametrisation for a two-dimensional body shown in :numref:`talwani_mag_method`, Talwani and Heirtzler's
(1964) :cite:`talwani1964` showed that the horizontal and vertical components of the total magnetic field are given by:


.. math:: V = 2(J_{x}Q - J_{z}P)
    :label: ﻿talwani_mag_vertical

.. math:: H = 2(J_{x}Q + J_{z}P)
    :label: talwani_mag_horizontal

where:

.. math:: P = \frac{z_{21}^2}{z_{21}^2+x_{12}^2}(\theta_{1}-\theta_{2}) +
    \frac{z_{21}x_{12}}{z_{21}^2+x_{12}^2} \log \frac{r_{2}}{r_1}
    :label: ﻿talwani_mag_P

.. math:: Q = \frac{z_{21}x_{12}}{z_{21}^2+x_{12}^2}(\theta_{1}-\theta_{2}) -
    \frac{z_{21}^2}{z_{21}^2+x_{12}^2} \log \frac{r_{2}}{r_1}
    :label: ﻿talwani_mag_Q

and:

.. math:: x_{12}=x_{1}-{x_2} \qquad z_{21}=z_{2}-z_{1} \qquad z_{1}=\sqrt{x_{1}^2+z_{1}^2}
    \qquad z_{2}=\sqrt{x_{2}^2+z_{2}^2}
    :label: ﻿talwani_mag_X

To account for the bodies magnetisation vector and its relationship with the model profile azimuth
:math:`J_{x}` and :math:`J_{z}` are then given by:

.. math:: J_{x} = J \cos A \cos(C-B)
    :label: talwani_mag_J_horizontal

.. math:: J_{z} = J \sin A
    :label: talwani_mag_J_vertical

where angle **A** is measured in the vertical plane from zero at the horizontal and positive downwards.
Angles **B** and **C** are measured in the horizontal plane, in a positive clockwise direction from geographic north,
as shown in :numref:`talwani_mag_angles`.

For the case when magnetisation is induced only:

.. math:: J = kH
    :label: talwani_mag_J_induced

where :math:`k` is the susceptibility contrast between the body and surrounding material and :math:`H` is the strength
of inducing field. Also, **A** will be equal to the inclination (**I**) and **B** will be equal to the declination
(**D**) of Earth's field Talwani and Heirtzler (1964) :cite:`talwani1964`.

For the case when magnetisation is remanent or a combination of remanent and induced, the angles **A** and **B** will require modification by the user to account for the difference
between the inducing field vector and remanent field vector.

    vertical plane connecting :math:`\vec{J}` to the horizontal x-y surface. A is the dip angle of :math:`\vec{J}`,
    measured in the vertical plane and equal to the inclination for induced magnetisation. B and C are
    the angles between geographic north and the horizontal projection of :math:`\vec{J}` and model profile
    (positive x-axis) respectively. These are measured clockwise from geographic north and B is equal
    to declination for induced magnetisation (modified after, Talwani and Heirtzler (1964) :cite:`talwani1964`).


The total magnetic anomaly is then given as the sum of the horizontal and vertical components in the model plane:

.. math::
    T = V \sin A + H \cos A \cos (C-B)

Talwani and Heirtzler (1964) method testing
-------------------------------------------

To assess the accuracy of the Talwani and Heirtzler (1964) :cite:`talwani1964` method, the magnetic anomaly determined
using the algorithm is compared to that of an exact analytic solution for a simple body. In this case, the solution
for a thin (width :math:`<<` depth) flat topped vertical sheet with a constant dip angle and magnetisation, which
extends infinitely into and out of the model plane and infinitely in depth is solved. The solution for this case
is given by, for example, Reford (1964) :cite:`reford1964` as:

.. math::
    \Delta T = 2kTb^{2}w  \left[ \frac{h}{R^{2}} \sin (2I-d) - \frac{x}{R^{2}} \cos(2I-d) \right]
    :label: reford_dyke

.. math::
    b^{2} = 1 - \cos{^2}i\sin{^2}D
    :label: b

.. math::
    I = tan^{-1}[ tan(i) cos(D) ]
    :label: i

Where :math:`k` is the magnetic susceptibility contrast between the sheet and its surroundings; :math:`T` is the
strength of the inducing field; :math:`w` is the width of the flat top of the sheet; :math:`h` is the depth to the
top of the dyke; :math:`i` is the angle of inclination measured downwards from the horizontal; :math:`D` is the angle
between magnetic north and the positive x axis (model profile azimuth); :math:`d` is the dip of the dyke measured
clockwise from the positive x axis (e.g. :numref:`talwani_mag_angles`).

This solution is used to simulate a vertical dyke of finite depth extent by calculating the anomalies
produced by two bodies, one where :math:`h=d_{1}` (the top of the dyke) and a second where :math:`h = d_{2}` (the
base of the dyke). The effect of the second dyke is subtracted from the first to leave the anomaly caused by a dyke
of finite depth extent :math:`d_{2}`.

:numref:`talwani_heirtz_test` shows anomalies calculated using the analytic solution and
the Talwani and Heirtzler (1964) :cite:`talwani1964` algorithm for a thin vertical sheet beginning at a depth of
1 :math:`km` and extending to 10 :math:`km` with no dip and a magnetic susceptibility of 0.001. Inclination and
declination are both 0 \degree, and the model azimuth is due north, such that, the sheet strikes east-west.
