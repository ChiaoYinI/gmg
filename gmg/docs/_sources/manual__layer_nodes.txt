**3.0 Model Layers**
====================

3.1 Adding a layer
------------------

To add a new layer to the model navigate to the *'Layers'* menu and select *'New Layer'*.

.. tip:: the *n* key is the keyboard shortcut for adding a new layer.

You will be prompted with the option of adding a *'New fixed layer'* or a *'New floating layer'*.

**Floating layers:**

Floating layers are polygons that are fully contained within the model space.

.. warning::

    Care must be taken to ensure the start and end nodes of floating layers remain to the left and right of each other respectively.
    It is possible to cross these nodes over. If this occurs, the calculated potential fields will be erroneous and the sign
    may be flipped.

**Fixed layers:**

Fixed layers span the entire width of the model and are useful for modelling features such as sedimentary basins.
Fixed layers have fixed boundary nodes that **can only** be moved vertically along the model edges.
These layers are padded out horizontally from the boundary nodes to 400 km either side of
the model in order to avoid edge effects.


3.2 Adding a New Node to a Layer
--------------------------------

To add a node to a layer place the mouse cursor at the position where you would like to add the new node and
press the *'i'* key to insert the new node.

3.3 Deleting a Node From a Layer
--------------------------------

To delete a node from a layer place the mouse cursor over the node you would like to delete and
press the *'d'* key to delete the new node.

3.4 Pinching nodes
------------------
To pinch a node onto a node of another layer: Press the *p* key to activate pinch mode.
Now left click to select the node you wish to pinch to another layer, then select the layer which you would like to pinch
to for editing and then click on the node to pinch to.

Alternatively, multiple nodes can be pinched or depinched simultaneously to either the layer above or layer below
(as defined in the layer order list) by selecting *'pinch layer'* in the Menubar.
A distance range over which to pinch/depinch nodes is then required.
