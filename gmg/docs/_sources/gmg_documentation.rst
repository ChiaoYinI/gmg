Overview
--------

GMG is designed primarily as a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for 2D forward
modelling of gravity and magnetic data. GMG can also load SEGY, well horizons
and XY point data, providing a full 2D geologic/geophysical profile
interpretation package.


GMG is written in python 2.7 using wx.python for GUI implementation. GMG makes
use of several other open source python packages to preform various tasks
(see `References <references.html>`_ for a detailed listing).
