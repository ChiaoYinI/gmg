Software Architecture
---------------------

GMG is arranged as a simple, multi-windowed graphical user interface as shown in :numref:`gmg_software_map`.
The software consists of two primary frames, the model frame and control frame. A third frame, containing an
inbuilt python console may also be displayed and used to access and edit model data via the command line.
Three control bars are used to access software features. The top menu bar contains a list of drop-down menus.
These are organised under various headings, such as “gravity data”, each containing relevant functions. Below this
menu bar is a shortcut button bar. At the base of the control frame, is a toggle bar. This contains five buttons that
are used to hide/show model frame panels (topography, gravity and magnetics), the control frame and the python console
frame. A “current status” bar is displayed at the base of the model frame, providing relevant information related to
the current state of the model.
