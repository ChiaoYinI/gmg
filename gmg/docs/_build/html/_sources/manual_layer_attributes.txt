**3.0 Layer attributes**
========================

Attributes refer to the physical properties assigned to a given model layer(polygon) and are used to calculate
the predicted gravity and magnetic anomalies. These include:

* Layer bulk density
* Model reference density
* Layer susceptibility contrast
* Magnetic field vector angle A
* Magnetic field vector angle B

Layer attributes are set using the **Attributes** sidebar within the modelling window or from the
**Attribute Table** which can be accessed from the top menubar. gmg is designed such that attributes can be
easily varied when modelling, to allow for rapid assessment of the effect of varying each attribute. A given attribute
need only be set if required for the given layer, if attributes are not set, the given layer will not contribute to
the modelled anomaly, be that gravity or magnetic. Angles A and B need only be set if the given layers magnetic vector
differs from the inducing field, as may be the case for remanent magnetism.

3.1 Bulk density
----------------

Gravity modelling is achieved using bulk **density contrasts** relative to a **reference density**.

Each layer requires:

1. A bulk density
2. A reference density

gmg defaults to a reference density of 0 :math:`kg` :math:`m^{-3}`. Hence, densities should be input as bulk **density contrasts**.
If you would rather input densities as absolute values, then you can set the reference density to your chosen value.
For example, popular choices for a bulk crustal reference density are 2670, 2700 and 2800 :math:`kg` :math:`m^{-3}` depending on
the particular geology in the region of interest. Set the paper by Hinze (2003) for more details.

YOu can als use a different reference density for different layers. This is useful if you which to model
crustal structure and relative to, for example, an upper crust of 2670 :math:`kg` :math:`m^{-3}`, lower crust
2900 :math:`kg` :math:`m^{-3}` and upper mantle of 3330 :math:`kg` :math:`m^{-3}`.

.. note:: All densities must be input using SI units :math:`kg` :math:`m^{-3}`.
          To assign density values use the *Attribute Sidebar* or the *Attribute table*.

For each layer both the bulk absolute density and the reference density must be set.

.. admonition:: Example

          To model a sedimentary basin typical absolute density values may be 2400 :math:`kg` :math:`m^{-3}` for the basin and
          2670 :math:`kg/m^3` as the reference density for the upper continental crust.

          To model crustal thickened from a reference crustal thickness of 32 km, thickened to 36 km, a lower crustal
          density of 2800 :math:`kg` :math:`m^{-3}` maybe be modelled against a upper most mantle reference density
          of 3330 :math:`kg` :math:`m^{-3}`.

.. tip:: To set all layer reference densities as a single value (e.g. when only modelling upper crustal structure)
         navigate to *'Gavity Field'* -> *'Set background density'*.

---------------------------
3.2 Magnetic Susceptibility
---------------------------

Susceptibility must be input using SI units.

A '*strike*' must also be assigned for each unit.

.. Important::

    *Strike* is the angle (in degrees) that the strike of the unit in map view makes with respect to magnetic north
    (the angle is positive when measured counterclockwise) See Won and Bevis (1987) for a diagram and further details.
    The strike of the unit is assumed to be orthogonal to the model transect (striking into and out of the screen).

.. admonition:: Example

    If the model is orientated West-East and magnetic north is -22 deg the strike of the unit is -22 deg.

    If the model was orientated North-South the angle would be 68 deg.
