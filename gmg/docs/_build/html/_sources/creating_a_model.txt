**1.0 gmg Models**
=====================

1.1 Creating a New Model
------------------------

Before creating a new model, it is recommended that you create a directory structure in which you will store and save
all of the data related to a given model. This can be structured in any way the user wishes but it is recommended that
you create a new master directory such as::

    mkdir gmg_MODEL

Then open the master directory::

    cd gmg_MODEL

and create the following directory structure::

    mkdir MODELS GRAVITY_DATA MAGNETIC_DATA SEGY_DATA WELL_DATA GEOLOGICAL_DATA POINT_DATA EXPORTS FIGURES

Now you are ready to create your model. Launch gmg and navigate to:

File -> New Model...

You will be prompted by a window in which to enter the new models dimensions and the spacing
increment at which potential field data is to be calculated (all units are km).

.. Tip::

    The model dimensions and spacing at which potential field data is calculated can be modified later by using the
    Model View -> Modify current Model Dimensions... option.

.. Tip::

    If a very high spatial resolution is required for predicted anomalies, it may be computationally beneficial to set
    the  spacing at which  potential field data is to be calculated as a relatively coarse value for initial modelling
    and later reduce this to the dense spacing that is required for the final model. This will prevent unnecessarily
    slowing the software down during initial modelling.


1.2 Saving a Model
------------------

To save a model navigate to Files -> Save Model...
This is prompt a save file menu from which you can navigate to the directory where you would like to dave your model,
for example gmg_MODEL/MODELS/

gmg models are saved as python Pickle files and must have a ".model" suffix, for example,
gmg_MODEL/MODELS/gmg_model_1.model


.. Tip::

    It is recommended that the user incrementally saves updated models with a new suffix such as model_1.model,
    model_2.model...etc

This will ensure you can revert back to previous models if your current model becomes corrupted.

1.2 Loading a Model
-------------------

To load a model navigate to Files -> Load Model...
Navigate to your required .model and select Open.

Your model will be loaded into the current gmg window.
