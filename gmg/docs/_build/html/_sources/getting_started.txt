**Getting Started**
====================

1. Launching the software:
-----------------------

Open a new terminal and launch gmg using the command gmg.py or the alias you may have setup.

2. Creating a new model:
---------------------

Navigate to the *file* menu and select *new model...*

Here you input: 
* 1. The new model dimensions in km
* 2. The spacing at which potential fields are to be calculated.

.. note::

    Setting this spacing as a relatively coarse value to begin with will ensure the program runs smoothly, 
    this can later be refined for detailed analysis once a first model is complete. 

3. Get Modelling!
------------------
You can now add layers and edit the model. 

See the Tools instructions for details on how to do this.
