#STATEMENT OF NEED#
###################

GMG is an Open Source Graphical User Interface designed principally for modeling 
2D potential field (gravity and magnetic) profiles. The software also includes 
functions for loading XY data, seismic reflection SEGY data, and well horizons. 
Hence, providing an integrated geological/geophysical interpretation package. It 
is anticipated  that GMG will also be useful for teaching purposes.

Input and output of data is made as simple as possible, using space delimited 
ASCII text files.

The project was instigated after failing to find an adequate open source option
(in which the source code can be viewed and modified by the user) for performing 2D 
geophysical modeling tasks. Inspiration came from fatiando a terra and GMT.

#############
INSTALLATION#
#############

GMG is written in Python 2.7 and relies on the following dependencies, which need
to be installed in order for the software to run.

#~~~~~~~~~~~~
#DEPENDENCIES
#~~~~~~~~~~~~

python 2.7
fatiando
matplotlib
numpy
obspy
scipy
wxpython

#~~~~~~~~~~
#INSTALLING
#~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to install gmg is using Anaconda Python distribution.
This should ensure you can install all the dependencies required simply
on any plateform (Linux, Mac, Windows) using the Conda package manager.

pip
https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/

This will install GMG and all of its dependencies with your local
anaconda python site-packages dir.

pip install gmg

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# STARTING GMG
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start gmg the best way is to create an alias and export this or add it 
manually to your .bashrc file.

alias gmg='python ~/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gmg/gmg.py'

Now on a command line simply type gmg to launch the software.

#################
#GETTING STARTED#
#################

It is recommended you run the two test cases when first launching the software
to check the potential field algorithms are running correctly.
Details can be found in the documentation. This can be accessed from within
the software:
Help -> Documentation
or
by opening gmg/gmg/docs/Manual.html

If the test cases do not work as expected, please submit a bug report as described below.

Once the test cases have been run (and work) the easiest way to get a feel for the 
software is run through the tutorial as described in the documentation.
